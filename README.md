# `transfigure.io`
##### *The best transgender support site ever.*

## Mission Statement

### What

`transfigure.io` is a one-stop shop information and support website for transgender people.
 
Information means guides, news, advice navigating legal and medical hurdles, etc. Support means chat rooms, a forum, and ways to get in touch with IRL support organizations.

### Why

Current solutions are not satisfactory to us in terms of looks, curation, usability, and feel.

We want to be accessible as a priority. The most vulnerable user is the one who has just heard the word “trans” for the first time and is unsure as to whether that applies to them. To this user we must provide a clean, informative, level-headed environment and avoid scaring them away with fluff, confusion, and unnecessary attitude. The key concepts here being: trans people are normal people; it’s a medical issue, nothing more; the solution doesn't require conforming to stereotypes or acting a certain way.
 
Next in our order of priorities are partners, parents, and family of transgender individuals. These people are also vulnerable, though less prone to tragic outcomes, and the environment they need to see is the same as above, with the key message being: the person you love is still the person you love; this is how you help them through, this is how you help yourself; there are some things to be concerned about but there’s no reason to despair. E.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/mypartneristrans/
 
Lastly, we have outsiders. Curious people, journalists, and so on. All these need is well-presented, accurate information.

### How

It’s a website. We may provide:

- A live chat section.
- A forum section.
- Relevant news.
- Articles/guides.
- A wiki.
- Tech education & mentoring for trans individuals.

### MVP

For minimum viable product we could have simply a static webpage providing some information and linking together chat and forum applications.
 
We also need a build process that goes GitHub → Live website.
