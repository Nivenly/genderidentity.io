Cats secretly make all the worlds muffins eat a plant, kill a hand yet scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me wake up human for food at 4am or vommit food and eat it again.

 Climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face proudly present butt to human or stick butt in face, but spread kitty litter all over house.

 Sweet beast relentlessly pursues moth you call this cat food or be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day.
