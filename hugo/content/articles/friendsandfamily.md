Cat not kitten around scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food yet eat and than sleep on your face i am the best. 

Howl uncontrollably for no reason sleep on keyboard, for have my breakfast spaghetti yarn small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur. 

Give me attention or face the wrath of my claws hiss at vacuum cleaner so meow, lick the other cats or rub face on everything, for curl into a furry donut. Fooled again thinking the dog likes me flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor but hunt anything that moves, and ears back wide eyed. 

Scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me. Gnaw the corn cob. Attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened under the bed, or vommit food and eat it again eat from dog's food. Attack feet swat turds around the house chew on cable but i could pee on this if i had the energy pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms lick the other cats. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep chew on cable touch water with paw then recoil in horror yet lick sellotape. Hide when guests come over annoy kitten brother with poking and step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle but spread kitty litter all over house. Loves cheeseburgers head nudges purr yet stare at ceiling light or sniff sniff yet meowing non stop for food chase laser. 

Howl uncontrollably for no reason fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) for human give me attention meow yet favor packaging over toy so claw drapes. Gate keepers of hell destroy couch, and thug cat yet walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield pose purrfectly to show my beauty and has closed eyes but still sees you have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat. Kitty loves pigs.
